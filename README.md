## Summary
- In conclusion, the results of the analysis suggests that there is no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. In contrast, it seems reviews not in the vine program had a slightly higher chance of having a 5 star review. This may be due to the fact that the majority of products are not in the Vine program. To further investigate, we could determine the total number and frequency of 1 star reviews, and/or average ratings.
